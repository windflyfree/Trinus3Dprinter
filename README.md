我和我的朋友们在二手市场上买了一批Trinus打印机，这是一款七八年前的打印机，全新。看起来是抵货的机子。Trinus这家公司似乎已经倒闭，我们买的价格非常低，大概在60美金左右。主要看重的是Trinus的四个滑台，比较坚固，适合改造成为激光雕刻机或者CNC雕刻机。

经过一个多月的大家的尝试，最终我们搞懂了主板的引脚、klipper的配置、热床的转接（原主板不支持直接接热床，需要mos，我们设计了专用的转接pcb）、激光、cnc等，期待能有机会折腾出更多更有趣的玩法。

My friends and I bought a batch of Trinus printers at a second-hand market. They are brand new machines from 7-8 years ago which seem to be surplus stock. Trinus, the company appears to have gone out of business. We got them for a very low price, around $60 each. The main feature we were interested in was Trinus' four sturdy sliders, which are suitable for converting into laser engravers or CNC routers. After more than a month of trial and error, we finally figured out the pinouts of the main board and configured Klipper.

We designed a dedicated adapter PCB for the hotbed (the original mainboard did not support direct connection to the heated bed and required a MOS module), as well as for laser engraving, CNC, and more. We hope to have the opportunity to explore and discover even more interesting ways to play with these machines. After all, technology knows no borders, and neither does human happiness and joy.
